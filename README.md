# Hardhat simple storage

This is my first project with hardhat. It's pretty simple and made with JS instead of TS.
It can add a "favorite number" and then retrieve it.
It also can add a person with a favorite number and a name, and then look for this person.
Only retrieve and store the number are tested. You can try it with

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
